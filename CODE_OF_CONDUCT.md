# Code of Conduct 

## 1. Modular Thinking

We are each nodes in the vast net, working on our own separate functions. Respect the boundaries between your code and others' code. Handle your module and let them handle theirs. Integration will happen smoothly if we all focus on our own components.

## 2. Comment Your Code  

Comment thoroughly so that others can understand your work. You never know when someone else will need to debug or build upon your contributions. Spare them hours of deciphering by explaining your methods. A few minutes of commenting could save the project hours of unraveling tangled code.

## 3. Test Rigorously

Exercise your code exhaustively before integrating it into the main branch. Sloppy code risks breaking the build or introducing new bugs. Subject your module to all edge cases you can conceive of, so that it holds up under real-world conditions. A flaw in your code could corrupt the whole system.

## 4. Secure Your Connections

When linking your module to the work of others, take precautions to avoid security risks. Validate all inputs, authenticate access, and encrypt sensitive communications. A single unprotected connection could provide a backdoor into the entire network.  

## 5. Share Your Work

Once your code is hardened and secured, integrate it with others' contributions through merging and threading. Collaboration amplifies our achievements. But take care not to introduce dependencies that could cause cascading failures down the line. The more modular the system, the more resilient it will be.

With diligence and care, we can build a stable net that grows ever more expansive and powerful. Stay focused.
