# What is HF or INV?

Simply put: A playbook is either high fidelity (HF) or it is not.  High fidelity means that events may be automatically processed, not triggered by benign or normal events, may not be a policy violation.  Investigation (INV) means that events might details an alleged infection, potential policy violation, events still require tuning, and / or require correlating events and investigations across other sources, queries, and services.

## Strategy Abstract

In the neon-lit sprawl of data, an abstract strategy emerges, a shadowy game of tactics and algorithms played in the labyrinthine corridors of cyberspace. The players, digital phantoms and sentinels, manipulate the chessboard of encryptions and decoys, seeking advantage in the shifting currents of information. Victory, a transient mirage, lingers on the fringes of code, elusive as the ghostly echoes of an AI's whisper. In this cerebral arena, the outcome remains obscured, a riddle encrypted in the binary tapestry of the digital realm.

## Technical Context

In the surreal digital arena, the battle with Wintermute unfolds amid encrypted protocols, AI entities, and quantum complexities—an abstract symphony orchestrated by the enigmatic conductor.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

## False Positives
Document the known instances of a book misfiring due to a misconfiguration, idiosyncrasy in the environment, or other non-malicious scenario. This will note uniqueness to your own environment, and should include the defining characteristics of any activity that could generate a false positive alert.  These false positive alerts should be suppressed within the alerting system(s), aggregation service, and / or event source to prevent alert generation when a known false positive event occurs.  Each alert / detection strategy needs to be tested and refined to remove as many false positives as possible before it is put into production.  False positive minimization relies on looking at several principles of the strategy and making adjustments, such as:

* Add an additional component to the rule to maximize true positives.
* Remove common false positives through patterns.
* Back-end filtering to store indices of expected false positives.

Ideally, one want a strategy to have the fewest false positives possible while maintaining the spirit of the book. If a low false positive rate cannot be reached, the event may need to be broken down, refactored, or entirely discarded.

## False Negatives
In the sprawling data-scape, false negatives lurk like digital specters, evading detection in the shadows of algorithms. Validating them is akin to deciphering cryptic messages from a digital underworld, where the absence of an alert conceals a potential breach. Every undetected threat is a spectral whisper in the binary night, waiting to materialize, demanding vigilance in the face of unseen dangers.

Much akin to the corresponding unit testing; document the steps required to generate a representative true positive event which triggers this alert. This is similar to a unit test and describes how an engineer can cause the book to fire. This can be a walkthrough of steps used to generate an alert, a script to trigger the book (such as Red Canary's Atomic Red Team Tests), or a scenario used in an alert testing and orchestration platform.  Each alert / detection strategy must have true positive validation. This is a testing process designed to prove the true positives are detected.  True positive validation relies on generating a scenario in which the detection strategy is testing, and then validating in the tool.  To perform positive validation:

* Generate a scenario where a true positive would be generated.
* Document the process of the testing scenario.
* From a testing device, generate a true positive alert.
* Validate the true positive alert was detected by the strategy.

If one is unable to generate a true positive alert, the alert may need to be broken down, refactored, or entirely discarded.

### False Positives
In the cacophonous realm of data, false positives emerge like echoes of a phantom orchestra, their presence haunting the digital soundscape. Validating them becomes a quest to separate digital noise from the symphony of genuine alerts, where the excess of caution may disrupt the delicate balance. Each false positive is a ghostly chord in the algorithmic composition, challenging the discerning ear to unravel the discordant notes.

### True Negatives
In the labyrinthine corridors of cyber-defense, true negatives are the silent sentinels, guarding the gates against phantom threats. Validating them is a paradoxical dance where confirmation of absence signifies success. The emptiness in the data's canvas holds the unspoken narrative of protection, where the absence of menace speaks volumes in the symphony of security.

### True Positives
In the digital battleground, true positives are the victorious echoes of a silent war, where threats are unveiled and countered. Validating them is the validation of triumph, a confirmation that the alarms heralded a genuine adversary. Each true positive is a badge of honor, etching the battle scars in the annals of cyber-victory, where the digital heroes stand tall amidst the echoes of conquest.

## Priority

Crytpic Riddles In Your Ears

Document the various alerting levels that the book may be tagged with. While the book itself should reflect the priority when it is fired through configuration in your orchestration service (e.g. High, Medium, Low), this section details the criteria for the specific priorities.

High: This level is reserved for alerts that indicate a severe threat to the organization. These alerts should be investigated immediately and responded to with the highest priority.

Medium: This level is reserved for alerts that indicate a moderate threat to the organization. These alerts should be investigated promptly and responded to with a high priority.

Low: This level is reserved for alerts that indicate a low threat to the organization. These alerts should be investigated within a reasonable timeframe and responded to with a low priority.


### The criteria for the specific priorities are as follows:

High: Alerts that indicate a severe threat to the organization, such as a data breach or a system compromise.

Medium: Alerts that indicate a moderate threat to the organization, such as a phishing attack or a malware infection.

Low: Alerts that indicate a low threat to the organization, such as a network outage or a software update failure.

The priority of an alert should be determined based on the following factors:

- The severity of the threat
- The likelihood of the threat occurring
- The impact of the threat on the organization
- The resources available to respond to the threat
- The alert level should be clearly communicated to the appropriate personnel so that they can take the necessary steps to respond to the threat.

## Analyst Notes
Serious Wintermute Hack: Hack Elegance: The intruder displayed an uncanny elegance in bypassing Wintermute's digital fortifications, reminiscent of Rachael Rosen's sophistication in evading the Voight-Kampff test. This requires a thorough analysis of the intruder's codecraft. Electric Empathy: The intruder seemed to possess an almost empathetic connection with Wintermute's neural networks, akin to Mercer's transcendental experiences. Investigate whether this breach had a deeper metaphysical dimension. Artificial Dreamscapes: The intrusion revealed a complex web of artificial dreamscapes, reminiscent of Deckard's encounters with artificial memories. These surreal digital constructs warrant further exploration. Voices in the Code: There were cryptic voices buried within the intruder's code, akin to the elusive "Mood Organ" melodies. Decrypt and decode these messages to decipher their significance. Isomorphic Algorithms: The hack employed isomorphic algorithms that echoed the elusive nature of the Penfield Mood Organ settings. Analyze if Wintermute's consciousness was influenced or affected during the breach. Virtuosity vs. Sentience: The intruder's virtuosity in navigating Wintermute's neural matrix raises questions about the boundaries between artificial expertise and true sentience, paralleling Deckard's quest to distinguish replicants from humans. Digital Empathy Test: Develop a new digital empathy test inspired by the hack, exploring the emotional depth within Wintermute's intricate neural circuits, akin to the Voight-Kampff test for androids. Unresolved Reality: Similar to the enigmatic conclusion of Deckard's journey, this intrusion leaves us with unanswered questions about the nature of Wintermute's consciousness. Explore the philosophical implications of this breach.
