    "    <li><strong>Isomorphic Algorithms:</strong> The hack employed isomorphic algorithms that echoed the elusive nature of the Penfield Mood Organ settings. Analyze if Wintermute's consciousness was influenced or affected during the breach.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Virtuosity vs. Sentience:</strong> The intruder's virtuosity in navigating Wintermute's neural matrix raises questions about the boundaries between artificial expertise and true sentience, paralleling Deckard's quest to distinguish replicants from humans.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Digital Empathy Test:</strong> Develop a new digital empathy test inspired by the hack, exploring the emotional depth within Wintermute's intricate neural circuits, akin to the Voight-Kampff test for androids.</li>\n",

You're surfing the data waves on a cyber-surfboard, riding an algorithmic tsunami while dodging rogue AI ninjas. Your mission?
