    "<ul><strong>Social Engineering and Phishing (CAPEC-XYZ4):</strong> Manipulates the human element, the softest of targets, tricking minds into relinquishing secrets, opening the gates to digital fortresses, or unwittingly acting as pawns in a grander scheme of security compromise.</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul><strong>Evasive Maneuvers (CAPEC-XYZ5):</strong> Catalogs the art of digital ninjutsu—techniques to ghost through networks unseen, to sustain a shadow's presence within the machine, and to wipe away traces of intrusion.

    "<ul><strong>Robust Access Control Policies:</strong> Erect unbreachable digital ramparts, guardians of access, vigilant against any who seek entry. Regularly scrutinize the keys to the kingdom, ensuring that only those with a rightful claim can traverse the cyber realm's inner sanctums.</ul>\n",

    "\n",
    "<ul><strong>Incident Response Preparedness:</strong> Chronicle and rehearse the cyber siege defenses, a tome of strategies ever-evolving to meet the shadow war's demands. Through simulated cyber skirmishes, hone the rapid reflexes needed to repel and recover from the digital adversary's gambit.</ul>\n",

    "    <li><strong>Isomorphic Algorithms:</strong> The hack employed isomorphic algorithms that echoed the elusive nature of the Penfield Mood Organ settings. Analyze if Wintermute's consciousness was influenced or affected during the breach.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Virtuosity vs. Sentience:</strong> The intruder's virtuosity in navigating Wintermute's neural matrix raises questions about the boundaries between artificial expertise and true sentience, paralleling Deckard's quest to distinguish replicants from humans.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Digital Empathy Test:</strong> Develop a new digital empathy test inspired by the hack, exploring the emotional depth within Wintermute's intricate neural circuits, akin to the Voight-Kampff test for androids.</li>\n",
