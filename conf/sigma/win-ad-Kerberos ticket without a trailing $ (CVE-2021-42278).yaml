title: Kerberos ticket without a trailing $ (CVE-2021-42278/42287)
description: Detects scenarios where an attacker attempts to spoof the SAM account name of a a domain controller in order to impersonate it. Vulnerability comes from that computer accounts should have a trailing $ in their name (i.e. sAMAccountName attribute) but no validation process existed until the patch was released. During the offensive phase, attacker will create and rename the sAMAccountName of a computer account to look like the one of a domain controller.
