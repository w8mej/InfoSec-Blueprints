# where
#             selection1: ImageFileName != selection1: OriginalFileName
#             selection1: ParentProcessGuid = selection2: ProcessGuid
#             selection1: Image = selection2: TargetFilename
# and new field ImageFileName is coming from enrichment
#             selection1: Image = ^.+\\<ImageFileName>$
# Rule must trigger if selection1 and selection2 both occurs in timeframe of 120 sec.
# Rule logic is currently not supported by SIGMA.
# Sysmon v.10.0 or newer is required for proper detection.
