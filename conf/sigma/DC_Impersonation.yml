title: SamAccountName Spoofing and Domain Controller Impersonation
status: experimental
author: \@kostastsale
description:  'This technique is to detect exploitation chain of CVE-2021-42287 (samAccountName Spoofing) and CVE-2021-42278 (Domain Controller Impersonation). 
    It is looking into event 4781 for evidence of a new computer account creation and account rename that matches the name of a domain controller account without
    ending in ‘$’. Computer account names always end with `$` and a change like this is highly unusual. 

    Immediately after the 4781 event, a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) must be requested on behalf of the newly created and renamed computer account.
    A computer account name event will occur before this TGT request.

    Putting everything together, we may use events 4781 and 4768 to look for a series of events in which the new computer account on event 4781 matches
    the requested account on event 4768.

    NOTE-- On selection2, the `TargetUserName` should equal to `NewTargetUserName`. I have left it as a placeholder but this should change dependingon the backend
    you are translating the query to.

    Splunk Example-- `| eval RenamedComputerAccount = coalesce(New_Account_Name, mvindex(Account_Name,0)) 
    | transaction RenamedComputerAccount endswith=(EventCode=4781)`'
